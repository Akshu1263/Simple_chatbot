# Simple Chatbot

This repository contains a basic chatbot project created as part of my learning in AI and Data Science. The chatbot demonstrates simple conversational logic and is a great starting point for exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features

- Basic rule-based conversation
- Python implementation
- Easy to understand and extend

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the Python script or notebook
3. Interact with the chatbot in the terminal or notebook

## Future Improvements

- Add NLP capabilities using libraries like NLTK or spaCy
- Integrate machine learning for better response prediction
- Build a simple web interface
